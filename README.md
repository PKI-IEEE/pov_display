# pov_display
Hand-waved persistence of vision display. The display uses an analogue accelerometer to 
detect when it is moving in a particular direction. 

Enter desired message into message1 and message2 arrays. Also update numCharFirstMessage and 
numCharSecondMessage with the number of characters in each respective message. The display is 
limited to 6 character messages. It is difficult to wave the display fast enough to display more
than 6 characters and the way the timing is set in this program, a word with more than 6 characters 
can get cut off.
